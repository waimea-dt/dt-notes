# CSS Basics

```css linenums="1" hl_lines="2 3"
body {
    color: red; /* (1)! */
    background-color: pink;
}
```

1.  Do this thing! :material-information-outline:

Men who --> **believe** that they are ==accomplishing== something by _speaking_ speak in a ~~different~~ better way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time. Drink H~2~O. Then calculate y=x^2^

Try pressing: ++ctrl+"C"++ or maybe just ++enter++

This **protocol** is likely to be TCP, but it could also be UDP... Who knows?! Protocol... What the heck is that?

```py linenums="1"
print("Hello, world!") # (1)!

from typing import Iterator

# This is an example
class Math:
    @staticmethod # (2)!
    def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
        """Fibonacci series up to n."""
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

result = sum(Math.fib(42))
print(f"The answer is {result}")
```

1.  Do this thing!
2.  And this

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.


```py {.show-indent}
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
        """Fibonacci series up to n."""
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b
```

It is commonly the case with technologies that you can get the best insight about how they work by watching them fail.

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Num: {i}")
```

```python exec="on"
print("``` title='Output'")
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Num: {i}")
print("```")
```

## Naming

Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, ==for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living. As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet.==

## Terminology

Create a file with `#!css body { color: red; }`

That is the problem with ignorance. You can never truly know the extent of what you are ignorant about. They dissemble, evade, prevaricate, confound, confuse, distract, obscure, subtly misrepresent and willfully misunderstand with what often appears to be a positively gleeful relish and are generally perfectly capable of contriving to give one an utterly unambiguous impression of their future course of action while in fact intending to do exactly the opposite, but they never lie.

=== "Idea One"

    We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.

    ```css
    .language-mermaid .node polygon {
        fill: var(--decision-back) !important;
        stroke: var(--decision-border) !important;
    }

    ```

    ![UK](../images/uk.png)

=== "Idea Two"

    The left side of my brain had been shut down like a damaged section of a spinship being sealed off, airtight doors leaving the doomed compartments open to vacuum. But the human race did not have even the slightest bit of psychological preparation for what was about to happen.

    ![Rainbow](../images/rainbow.jpg)

    /// caption
    A beautiful rainbow!
    ///

=== "Idea Three"

    An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.

## Rules

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I will allow my fear to pass through me and around me and when it is gone, I will turn and look, and only myself will remain.

It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers.

What's hard, in hacking as in fiction, is not writing, it's deciding what to write. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

Well, all information looks like noise until you break the code. A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet.

The advantage that religion has over magic or science is that man's inability to understand is built into the system, so if an explanation is confusing or unsatisfying, it strengthens the point.
