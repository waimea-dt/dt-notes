# Glossary of Key Terms

## General

Digital Technologies
:   A subject area covering computer hardware, computer software, computer science and anything else relating to the use of digital data-processing devices

## Data Representation

Bit
:   A binary digit (0 or 1). Binary numbers use 'base-2', a counting system that only uses the digits 0 and 1 (unlike decimal which uses digits 0 to 9)

Byte
:   A group of 8 bits. Bytes are the basic unit data storage and data transfer. Larger amounts of data might be measured in kB, MB, GB, TB, PB or EB


## Computer Hardware

Central Processor Unit (CPU)
:   The 'brain' of a computer. The CPU processes data fed into it via the system bus. It follows instructions in computer programs, performs calculation, makes decisions, etc. CPU speed is generally measured in GigaHertz (GHz), measuring the number of processing cycles-per-second each CPU core is capable of: a 5GHz core can perform 5,000,000,000 operations per second!

CPU Core
:   A processing unit within a CPU. Each core can run in parallel with the others. Modern CPUs will often have over a dozen cores.

Memory (RAM and ROM)
:   Computer memory is where data and program instructions are stored whilst the computer is running. Random-access memory (RAM) is temporary (volatile), whilst  read-only memory (ROM) keeps data even when powered off (non-volatile). BIOS / UEFI settings are usually stored in ROM

Storage Devices
:   Solid-State Drive (SSD), Hard Disc Drive (HDD), Floppy Disc Drive (FDD)

Graphics Card (GPU)
:   A specialist type of data processing unit, focussed on processing data to render graphics on the screen. GPU speed is measured in FLOPS. Modern GPUs can perform at TFLOPS speed

Peripheral
:   Hardware devices that are not part of the 'core' computer hardware (peripheral means 'around the edge'), such as keyboards, mice, printers, etc.

Bus
:   A collection of data transfer wires that allow data to be transferred between hardware devices

System Bus
:   A number of buses that connects the CPU, RAM, ROM, IO, and other systems within a computer. Usually includes a data bus, an address bus, a control bus, and a peripheral bus such as PCIe

Universal Serial Bus (USB)
:   A serial communication system often used to connect peripheral devices to a computer


## Computer Networks

Network
:   An inter-connected set of devices, linked by cables or wireless links

Internet
:   A global 'inter-network', consisting of millions of linked networks

Local Area Network (LAN)
:   A network that connects devices within a limited area (e.g. a home, school or workplace)

Wide Area Network (WAN)
:   A network that spans multiple sites across a wide geographical area

Telecommunication
:   Communicating (sharing information) over long distances ('tele' means far)

World-Wide Web (WWW)
:   A collection of hypertext documents (usually stored as web sites), shared over a network using HTTP or HTTPS

EtherNet
:   A type of wired network, commonly used in LANs


### Network Protocols

Protocol
:   A set of rules / standards used for communication

Medium Access Control (MAC)
:   A hardware addressing protocol, providing a unique 48-bit 'MAC' address to hardware devices, of the form: 00-B0-D0-63-C2-26

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
:   A

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
:   A

Internet Protocol (IP)
:   A

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
:   A

File Transfer Protocol (FTP and SFTP)
:   A

Domain Name Service (DNS)
:   A

Voice over IP (VOIP)
:   A


## Computer Programming

Computer Program
:   A set of instructions that a computer will follow to solve a task

Machine Code
:   Computer instructions that the CPU can run directly. The instructions are simply binary values that can be read into the CPU

Low-Level Language
:   Code that the CPU can understand and run (machine code)

High-Level Language
:   Code that is easy for humans to understand. High-level languages include Python, C#, JavaScript, etc. This code can't be run by the CPU directly, but must first be translated into machine code.


## Web Development

WWW
:   World Wide Web

HTTP
:   HyperText Transfer Protocol

HTTPS
:   HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (Encrypted)

HTML
:   Hyper Text Markup Language

CSS
:   Cascading Style Sheets

PHP
:   PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (originally 'Personal Home Page')

JS
:   JavaScript


## Images and Graphics

Bitmap Image
:   An image made up of a 2D grid of pixels. Examples of bitmap image files are PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF

Vector Image
:   An image drawn from a set of instructions that draw lines, circles, rectangles, etc. Usually saved as SVG files


## User Interfaces (UIs)

User Interface (UI)
:   The system by which a human user can interact with a computer (HCI). Sometimes this is graphical (GUI) and sometimes the user must type commands (CLI).

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
:   A system for HCI that shows outputs to the user in a graphical format (windows, text, images, charts, etc) and allows input via interactions with graphical elements (buttons, sliders, menus, links, etc). Sometimes GUIs are called WIMP interfaces

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
:   An HCI system where the user must type in commands to control the computer, and where the output from the system is in the form of text

User Experience (UX)
:   The overall feeling (good or bad) that is had from interacting with a computer system


## Computer Science Topics

Computer Science (CS)
:   The study of computer systems and how they can be used to process information


### Formal Languages

Finite State Automata (FSA)
:   Systems that

### Data Encoding

Finite State Automata (FSA)
:   Systems that

### Cryptography

### Complexity and Tractability

Complexity
:   The amount of time / 'effort' it takes for a problem to be solved

Tractable
:   A problem that can be solved within a 'reasonable' amount of time

Intractable
:   A problem that can't be solved within a 'reasonable' amount of time

Travelling-Salesperson Problem (TSP)
:   A famous, intractable problem

:   Documented policies and procedures or commonly accepted practices of the school.

Plan
:   To decide on or arrange things in advance.

Presentation
:   Refers to the look and feel of the document. For example, have the design principles of harmony, alignment, contrast repetition, proximity and balance been applied, is there a system of text hierarchy?

Protocols
:   A way of carrying out a process.
