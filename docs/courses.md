## Year 9 Courses

### 9DTF (Foundation)

When you are wrestling for possession of a sword, the man with the handle always wins. You know, the less you talk, the more people assume that what you're not saying is important. What's hard, in hacking as in fiction, is not writing, it's deciding what to write. The closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, the more impatient they seemed to become with it, and with themselves as well. Nothing is more important than that you see and love the beauty that is right in front of you, or else you will have no defense against the ugliness that will hem you in and come at you in so many ways.


### 9DTA (Advanced)

That is the problem with ignorance. You can never truly know the extent of what you are ignorant about. As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. That is the problem with ignorance. You can never truly know the extent of what you are ignorant about. Still, the underlying point held; experience as well as common sense indicated that the most reliable method of avoiding self-extinction was not to equip oneself with the means to accomplish it in the first place.

### 10DTA (Advanced)

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The keel-mounted rail gun pushed the whole ship backward in a solid mathematical relationship to the mass of the two-kilo tungsten round moving at a measurable fraction of c.

Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.

## NCEA Courses

### 100DTD (Development & Coding)

In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. That is the problem with ignorance. You can never truly know the extent of what you are ignorant about. The left side of my brain had been shut down like a damaged section of a spinship being sealed off, airtight doors leaving the doomed compartments open to vacuum. It is easy to look at these waves, accomplishing so little and to think that no matter what efforts we put forth in our lives, all we're really doing is rearranging the sand grains in a beach that in essence never changes.

### 200DTD (Development & Coding)

Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error. It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers. The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time. Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living. The keel-mounted rail gun pushed the whole ship backward in a solid mathematical relationship to the mass of the two-kilo tungsten round moving at a measurable fraction of c.

### 300DTD (Development & Coding)
