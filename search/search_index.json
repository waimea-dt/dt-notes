CPU Core A processing unit within a CPU. Each core can run in parallel with the others. Modern CPUs will often have over a dozen cores. Memory (RAM and ROM) Computer memory is where data and program instructions are stored whilst the computer is running. Random-access memory (RAM) is temporary (volatile), whilst  read-only memory (ROM) keeps data even when powered off (non-volatile). BIOS / UEFI settings are usually stored in ROM Storage Devices Solid-State Drive (SSD), Hard Disc Drive (HDD), Floppy Disc Drive (FDD) Graphics Card (GPU) A specialist type of data processing unit, focussed on processing data to render graphics on the screen. GPU speed is measured in FLOPS. Modern GPUs can perform at TFLOPS speed Peripheral Hardware devices that are not part of the 'core' computer hardware (peripheral means 'around the edge'), such as keyboards, mice, printers, etc. Bus A collection of data transfer wires that allow data to be transferred between hardware devices System Bus A number of buses that connects the CPU, RAM, ROM, IO, and other systems within a computer.

More... Brief Describes the outcome to be developed: the needs of the stakeholder. It should tell the developer what has to be done and why and contain a set of specifications and constraints that define the requirements. Conceptual Design A clear indication of the final outcome. Constraints Limitations or restrictions on the development of the digital product: resources, time, budget, etc. Data integrity Ensuring that data is accurate, valid and consistent. Enhance To improve, make more effective. Evaluation Determining the success or worth of something Fitness for Purpose Judging if an outcome can do the intended job: resolves the issue identified, meets the requirements, etc. Identify Give an acceptable name or label. Distinguish between. Justification A clear rationale that supports the selection of a tool or technique. Legibility A measure of how easy something is to read: a clear typeface, good contrast, etc. Organisational requirements Documented policies and procedures or commonly accepted practices of the school. Plan To decide on or arrange things in advance. Presentation Refers to the look and feel of the document. For example, have the design principles of harmony, alignment, contrast repetition, proximity and balance been applied, is there a system of text hierarchy? Protocols A way of carrying out a process. Purpose What the digital outcome is trying to achieve. That is, why the document is being produced. Accessibility Supporting people with disabilities to access systems and information Readability Ease of comprehension of the text. Specifications Define what the outcome will look like and how will it function. Stakeholder Those who are directly or indirectly impacted by the digital outcome. Target Audience The specified group in society for which the digital outcome is designed or to whom the finished document should appeal. Testing Conducting an investigation to provide information about the quality of the outcome. For example, does the project function as it should, does it actually work? Testing Procedures A documented plan used to test a digital outcome for fitness for purpose and functionality.
